# Overview

![Drone Example](/images/drone-catch.gif =140x250)

This dataset contains 74 images of aerial maritime photographs taken with via a Mavic Air 2 drone and 1,151 bounding boxes, consisting of docks, boats, lifts, jetskis, and cars. This is a multi class problem. This is an aerial object detection dataset. This is a maritime object detection dataset.

The drone was flown at 400 ft. ~~No drones were harmed in the making of this dataset.~~

This dataset was collected and annotated by the Roboflow team, released with MIT license.

# Use Cases

* Identify number of boats on the water over a lake via quadcopter.
* Boat object detection dataset
* Aerial Object Detection proof of concept
* Identify if boat lifts have been taken out via a drone
* Identify cars with a UAV drone
* Find which lakes are inhabited and to which degree.
* Identify if visitors are visiting the lake house via quad copter.
* Proof of concept for UAV imagery project
* Proof of concept for maritime project
* Etc.

This dataset is a great starter dataset for building an aerial object detection model with your drone.
